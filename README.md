# Analog DAC for AY-891x family of Programmable Sound Generators

Recreation of the logarithmic 4-bit DAC from AY-8910/AY-8912/AY-8913. Inspired and informed by [silicon reverse engineering](https://github.com/lvd2/ay-3-8910_reverse_engineered) of the orginal chip.

This DAC could also be used for SN76489.

This work was done as excercise for [Zero To ASIC Analog course](https://zerotoasiccourse.com/#asic-def) and will be part of the open-source silicon recreation of AY-8913. Also check open-source silicon effort for Z80 CPU.
